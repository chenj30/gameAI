Game AI - Homework 1 - Single Agent Movement

I was able to implement all the required algorithms (dynamic pursuit and arrive, dynamic evade, dynamic wander, and pathfollowing). However, I was not able to implement the visual cues for each algorithm besides the arrival radius and the path for pathfollowing. 

Yellow arrow - Dynamic Pursuit and Arrive to the Blue arrow
Green arrow - Dynamic Evade of the Blue arrow(the white circle is the area where the agents starts to evade)
Blue arrow - Dynamic Wander
Red arrow - Pathfollowing on the white path with 4 nodes
